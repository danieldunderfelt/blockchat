# Blockchat

A blockchain-powered forum of some sort. Only for playing around with the blockchain. Mining is done by posting new messages, and the "coins" are upvotes, like if someone made Reddit karma into a cryptocurrency. Posting a message is the only way to get coins as of now.

Let's see where it goes!

Run `docker-compose up` to spawn three interconnected nodes, or just run `npm run start-server` for the one node boring version.

UI will be done with React, but that's not even started yet.
